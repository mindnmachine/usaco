/*
    There are N piles of coins each containing  Ai (1<=i<=N) coins.
    Find the minimum number of coins to be removed such that the absolute difference of coins in
    any two piles is at most K.

    Note: You can also remove a pile by removing all the coins of that pile.

    Example 1:
    Input:
        N = 4, K = 0
        arr[] = {2, 2, 2, 2}
    Output:
        0

    Explanation:
        For any two piles the difference in the
        number of coins is <=0. So no need to
        remove any coins.

    Example 2:
    Input:
        N = 6, K = 3
        arr[] = {1, 5, 1, 2, 5, 1}
    Output :
        2
    Explanation:
    If we remove one coin each from both
    the piles containing 5 coins , then
    for any two piles the absolute difference
    in the number of coins is <=3.

    Approach: Since we cannot increase the number of coins in a pile.
        So, the minimum number of coins in any pile will remain the same as they canâ€™t be removed,
        and increasing them will add to the operations which we need to minimize.
        Now, find the minimum coins in a pile, and for every other pile if the difference between
        the coins in the current pile and the minimum coin pile is greater than K then remove
        the extra coins from the current pile.
