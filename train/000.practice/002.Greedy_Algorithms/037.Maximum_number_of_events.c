/*
    Maximum number of events that can be attended

    There are N events in Geek's city. You are given two arrays start[] and end[] denoting starting
    and ending day of the events respectively. Event i starts at start[i] and ends at end[i].

    You can attend an event i at any day d between start[i] and end[i] (start[i] â‰¤ d â‰¤ end[i]).
    But you can attend only one event in a day.

    Find the maximum number of events you can attend.

    Example 1:
        Input:
            N = 3
            start[] = {1, 2, 1}
            end[] = {1, 2, 2}
        Output:
            2
        Explanation:
            You can attend a maximum of two events.
            You can attend 2 events by attending 1st event
            at Day 1 and 2nd event at Day 2.
    Example 2:
        Input:
            N = 3
            start[i] = {1, 2, 3}
            end[i] = {2, 3, 4}
        Output :
            3
        Explanation:
            You can attend all events by attending event 1
            at Day 1, event 2 at Day 2, and event 3 at Day 3.
