/*
Find maximum possible stolen value from houses

There are n houses build in a line, each of which contains some value in it.
A thief is going to steal the maximal value of these houses,
but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of the stolen houses
will tell his two neighbors left and right side. What is the maximum stolen value?

Examples:


    Input: hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4}
        Output: 19

    Explanation: The thief will steal 6, 1, 8 and 4 from the house.

    Input: hval[] = {5, 3, 4, 11, 2}
        Output: 16

    Explanation: Thief will steal 5 and 11

int max(int a, int b) {
    return (a > b ? a : b);
}

// calculate the maximum stolen value
int maxLoot(int *hval, int n, int memory[])
{
   // base case
   if(n < 0) {
        return 0;
   }

   if(n == 0){
        return hval[0] ;
   }

   if (memory[n] != -1) {
       return memory[n];
   }

   //if current element is pick then previous cannot be picked
   int pick = hval[n] +  maxLoot(hval, n-2, memory) ;

   //if current element is not picked then previous element is picked
   int notPick = maxLoot(hval, n-1, memory);

   // return max of picked and not picked
   memory[n] = max(pick, notPick);
   return memory[n];
}

// Driver to test above code

{
    int hval[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 4};
    int n = sizeof(hval)/sizeof(hval[0]);

    memset(memory, -1, sizeof(memory));
