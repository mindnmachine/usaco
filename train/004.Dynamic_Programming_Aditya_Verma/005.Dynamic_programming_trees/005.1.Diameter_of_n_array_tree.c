/*
    The diameter of an N-ary tree is the longest path present between any
    two nodes of the tree. These two nodes must be two leaf nodes.

    The path can either start from one of the nodes and
    go up to one of the LCAs of these nodes and again come down
    to the deepest node of some other subtree or can exist as a diameter
    of one of the child of the current node.

    The solution will exist in any one of these:
    I] Diameter of one of the children of the current node
    II] Sum of Height of the highest two subtree + 1
