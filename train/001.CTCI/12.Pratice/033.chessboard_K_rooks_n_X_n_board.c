/*
Count of rooks that can attack each other out of K rooks placed on a N*N chessboard

    Given pair of coordinates of K rooks on an N X N chessboard,
    the task is to count the number of rooks that can attack each other.
    Note: 1 <= K <= N*N

    Input: K = 2, arr[][] = { {2, 2}, {2, 3} }, N = 8
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Both the rooks can attack each other, because they are in the same row.
                 Therefore, count of rooks that can attack each other is 2


    Input: K = 1, arr[][] = { {4, 5} }, N = 4
    Output: 0

    Approach: The task can easily be solved using the fact that,
              2 rooks can attack each other if they are either in the same row
              or in the same column, else they canâ€™t attack each other.

                // Check if rooks are in same row or same column
                if ((arr[i][0] == arr[j][0]) || (arr[i][1] == arr[j][1])) {
                    ans++;
                }
            }
        }
